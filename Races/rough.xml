            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Faerie elves are roughly the same height as gnomes but weigh roughly 25 to 60 lbs. Faeries tend to have more vibrant eye colors of shimmering greens, blues, and reds. They have a pair of transparent wings that allow them to fly. Other than that they look like most wood elves.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Although not many people have seen these crossbreeds, the faerie elf is a mixture of a elf and a fey. They tend to keep their societies and culture hidden from public view. Faerie elves are known to have many conflicts within their society, from what little has been observed. They tend to have very different views of other races and cultures. There are two primary groups, or "Factions", the faeries tend to choose from, and both come with their own set of special traits and physical appearances; Chaotic and Tranquil.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Faerie elves tend to keep to themselves and tend to hide from other outside sources, mainly due to the harsh discrimination and prejudice their ancestors have experienced. They are buried deep within forests and caves and have a strong sense of family. They tend to have a hard time developing new relations with others, especially if they're neither fey, elf, or faerie. The ones who do leave the villages tend to be brave adventurers determined to prove the old ways are over.</p>
            <h4>FAERIE ELF NAMES</h4>
            <p>Faerie Elves tend to take their name after elf or fey names. It's recorded that some Faerie's names are of exotic plants</p>
